Ours began when we realized that couples deserved more than just traditional cards to announce the most special day of their lives. We were born from a shared dream: to transform the way couples connect with their loved ones before the big day.",
      "text2": "What started as a conversation between friends passionate about design and weddings became Invited.es. Every line of code, every design, and every word we create carries the excitement of those who understand that an invitation is not just paper or pixels: it is the first chapter of an unforgettable celebration.",

Because we understand that small decisions, like choosing the perfect font or the ideal color, are also part of the journey to saying 'I do.'",
